# Fake Currency Detection Using CNN

This project is a Fake Currency Detection system that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images of currency notes as real or fake. It combines custom-built CNN models and powerful pretrained models like MobileNet and ResNet50 to achieve accurate detection. The system trains on labeled image datasets, performs image augmentation for robustness, and predicts the authenticity of new currency images.

## ðŸ’¡ Usage

1. Prepare your dataset folders with images labeled as real or fake currency.  
2. Run the training script to train deep learning models.  
3. Visualize training progress and accuracy graphs.  
4. Save the trained model to reuse later.  
5. Load the saved model and predict on new currency images.  
6. Get the prediction: "Real" or "Fake".

7. Make sure your dataset folder structure looks like this:

- /Train/Real/
- /Train/Fake/
- /Test/Real/
- /Test/Fake
